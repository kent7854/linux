# linux
Linux commands and things I need to remember so I don't have to keep looking them up.

This is just going to be a list of commands, issues, etc that I keep running into and then figuring out but not remembering exactly how.

I will try to provide relevance to why operating system I did something in, but guessing for the most part they will be relatively Linux agnostic simply because I'm not getting too into the weeds just yet.
